I was born in Santarém, Amazon, Brazil. I lived with my family there until my 21 years old. I moved to Manaus in 2006 for finish my studies on the college. I graduated in Information Systems at Lutheran University Center of Manaus (CEULM/ULBRA) in 2008. During my graduation, I had a fellowship's project in The Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) on the National Institute Amazonian Research (INPA). Since 2010 until 2012 I I moved to São Carlos, São Paulo, Brazil and did my Masters Degree in Computer Sciences and Computational Mathematics at the Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science (ICMC) of the University of São Paulo (USP). Currently, I am  Phd candidate in Computer Sciences and Computational Mathematics at ICMC of the USP.
