### Resume
My name is John Garavito Suárez. I was born in Colombia. I did my graduation in Systems Engineering at UIS Colombia. During my graduation, I worked as a system engineer (trainee) at Industrial University of Santander, my job responsibilities includes the development of web systems to supporting the decision making process in agricultural planning (EcoGranja System). Additionally, I worked as a web developer for one year in the development of web systems to support modeling with system dynamics (Evolucion Web Platform).

In these projects I learned about back-end web technologies like DBMS (Posgres), programming languages (Java, Ruby and Python), back-end frameworks (Spring, Ruby on Rails and Django) and the foundations of front-end web development (HTML, JS and CSS)

Currently, I am doing  my M.Sc in Computer Sciences at the University of São Paulo (ICMC-USP).  I am working on my research project under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Dilvan Moreira.
