*[DSL](/project/dsl) Subproject*

This technology will provide a specific language and knowledge representation based on ontologies, that will allow the specification and generation of web based decision support systems, supporting the next functionalities: 

* Definition of evaluation objects 
* Definition of characteristics to evaluate  
* Definition of formula 
* Report specification

The DSL describes how the web support system will be generated, allowing the definition of evaluation objects and its properties, each one of the properties are defined in ontologies that represent the behavior of object and a widget that defines the representation in GUIs.
